One function of an operating system is providing the user with an interface. There are two types of interfaces; The Graphical User Interface and the Command Line Interface. 
The GUI is the interface everyone is familiar with. It's the interface you navigate by clicking on certain icons or anything interactive on the screen. The mouse is used for this interface.
The Command Line Interface is the interface navigated by the keyboard and typing in certain commands. This isnt the default interface and there is a special way to access it.
